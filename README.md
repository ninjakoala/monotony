```clojure
(ns yourapp
  (:require [ninjakoala.monotony :refer [redirect-logging!]]))

(redirect-logging!)
```

This will go ahead and replace all timbre appenders with a single appender which uses `clojure.tools.logging/log` instead.

# monotony

Redirects [timbre](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre) logging into [tools.logging](https://github.com/clojure/tools.logging).

## Justification

It's definitely not that I don't like timbre. I think it's a great idea and am looking forward to using it properly in the future. However, at `$DAYJOB` we already have well-established custom [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) appenders and have finally got all our existing libraries to redirect their logging to [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/). I don't have time at the moment and I love [carmine](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine) too much to have its logging go somewhere else.
